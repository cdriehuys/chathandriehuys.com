<p class="lead">
  What I need to know about weather sources as a private pilot.
</p>

<!--more-->

Official sources:

- 1-800-WX-BRIEF
- NOAA
- METARs and SPECIs
- TAFs
- weather.gov products

Very helpful to use a source that keeps a record of when you accessed it. This
provides proof in case of an incident that you pulled the weather. Foreflight
records when you pull a flight briefing.
