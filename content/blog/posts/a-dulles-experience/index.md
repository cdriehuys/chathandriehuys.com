The plane lands. A smooth touchdown. You're glad that your longest flight is now
over. Nine hours across the Atlantic. It takes a while to get off the plane, but
no longer that usual. This is fine. You walk along the secured corridor at the
edge of the terminal to get to the immigration line. As you round the corner,
you're suddenly halted by a queue of people lined up down a descending ramp. A
line for immigration control? No. A line to get on the People Mover.

Now a People Mover may not be much to look at (shipping container dropped onto
a chasis), but it's certainly a shining example of efficiency. After the doors
close, you wait a painfully long time as the passenger compartment is lowered
from 

* People movers
* Travel across the whole airport to get to customs?
* Immigration staffing
* Pick up baggage just to drop it off 100 yds later???
* Walk through caverns of empty space
