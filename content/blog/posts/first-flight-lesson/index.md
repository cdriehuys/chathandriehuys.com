My notes from my first flight lesson with [FlightGest][flightgest] at KRDU.

## Preflight

* I was the most comfortable with this portion of the lesson since I'd already
  preflighted (preflit?) the plane three times previously.
* Don't forgot to remove all the tie-downs and chocks during the walk around.
  * This is where the second overview walk around is useful.

## Engine Start

* Pretty straightforward procedure.
* I still need to get a feel for the engine.
  * When it "coughs" before you supply fuel.
  * How to lean the engine based on when it's running rough.

## Taxiing

* I was prepared for the concept of steering with my feet, but obviously it
  takes practice to get the airplane to do exactly what you want.
* I think the biggest difference from the only other vehicle I've ever
  controlled (a car) is that the throttle remains where you put it.
  * In a car, you take your foot of the gas, and the engine immediately stops
    applying power.
  * In a plane, you stop manipulating the throttle, and you maintain your power
    output.
  * It's much easier to provide conflicting inputs in the plane, such as braking
    while still applying too much power.

## Run Up

* I was still processing the taxiing I had done to the run up area, so the run
  up process did not sink in as much as it probably should have.
* In addition to what's on the checklist, I need to clarify the procedures that
  aren't listed.
  * Mostly checking the G1000 to make sure we have satellite coverage and all
    the equipment is coming up green.

## More Taxiing

* A review of the airport taxi diagram helped a lot. Even knowing only the major
  taxiways helps a lot.
  * Gets you an idea of what taxi instructions to expect
  * You have a better idea of where you're going
* I struggled with multitasking during taxi.
  * When I focused on staying centered, we tended to gain too much speed.
  * When I focused on speed, I tended to drift off the center line.
* It was super cool to hear a Spirit jet instructed to "follow the Cessna from
  your right."
  * Also important to listen to everyone taxiing so you have an idea of what
    other planes are doing and any potential conflicts.

## Takeoff

* The C172S flaps don't have detents, so you have to be precise about moving the
  lever.
* I shadowed my instructor's inputs here because we were asked to expedite our
  departure.

## Climb Out

* We climb out a little over __Vy__.
* I need to remember to include the climb angle in my instrument scan.

## Maneuvering

* Use visual references such as bolts on the dashboard to know what the plane is
  doing.
  * Find references for those markers during various maneuvers.
    * ie, if this bolt on the dashboard is above the horizon during this turn,
      then I'm climbing.
* Fly the plane, not the tape
  * Use visual cues from outside to fly the plane, then check against a scan of
    the instruments.

### Altitude Changes

* Climbs
  * Full power, then pitch for the desired airspeed during the climb.
  * At the desired altitude, pitch to hold altitude, let the plane accelerate to
    cruise speed, then reduce to cruise power. Trim as necessary.
* Descents
  * Pull out power; let the airplane's nose drop naturally.
  * Restore cruise power at the desired altitude and use pitch to stay level.
    Again, trim as necessary.

### Turns

* Again, visual references are key. Lining up markers on the inside of the plane
  with the horizon lets you hold altitude without relying primarily on the
  instruments.
* I struggled to hold altitude and bank angle in turns.
  * My instructor pointed out that I was applying pulses of inputs rather than
    holding constant pressure.
  * Find the constant input needed to hold particular bank angle and altitude,
    and keep it steady.

## Approach and Landing

* I think my brain was rather full at this point.
* It felt like the approach and final were just "happening" rather than feeling
  like I was landing an airplane. I certainly can't recall how much my
  instructor assisted the landing process, but we got on the ground without too
  much of a jolt.

## Taxi Back and Shutdown

* I was much better at taxiing after we landed than I was prior to taking off.
  * I think this was because I got more used to manipulating the throttle in
    flight.
* The shut down and securing checklists are pretty straightforward.
* My tension knots for tying down the airplane need some serious work.

## Overview

Flying is awesome. I loved the feeling of being up in the air. However, I was
finally able to see how someone could get overwhelmed with flying and not want
to continue. I was totally drained after my lesson, and I ended up just eating
dinner and going to bed right after. After about a day though, I was ready to go
back up, and now I'm looking forward to my next lesson. It is a ton of new
information, but as my instructor said, flying is so unlike anything else you've
done in your life that there is no way to go about it other than drinking
straight from the fire hose.
