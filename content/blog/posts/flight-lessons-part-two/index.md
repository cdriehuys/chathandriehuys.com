Working title: Getting into flying

I've always taken at least a passing interest in aviation, and I'm pretty certain I have my dad
to thank for that. I remember standing with him by the window at the airport,
looking out at the plane we would be departing on shortly. Or in the days when
business travel was a thing, we would go to drop him off at the airport, then
spend some time at the observation deck just watching planes go in and out.
Every conversation with my dad about planes inevitabely ended up the same way:
him saying "maybe I'll get my pilot's license one day", and me agreeing in
that non-committal way you do when something sounds good, but you definitely
don't intend to follow up.

Fast-forward many moons to 2020. The pandemic hits, I have a boatload of free
time, and
[Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020][msfs2020] drops. I've had a long standing
interest in simulator titles. From the explainable genres such as racing, to the
inexplicable satisfaction found in virtual truck driving, to the complex world
of flight simulation. And there's a particular sense of accomplishment that
I get from doing it rightâ„¢ (or as close to the real world as I can get).

As I'm sitting there, Googling about how to start my fake airplane in the right
order, or what speeds I should be traveling at, or how to actually plan a flight
path, I thought, why not do this for real?

And so I did.

I found a flight school at my local airport, went up for a discovery flight, and
loved it. The feeling of flying a small airplane is such a rush. So with the
introductory flight being such a success, I immediately booked my first lessons.
As soon as we got passed the initial ground school, something felt off

* Started hoping for bad weather/not feeling well
* Stopped due to eye surgery

* Heard about new flying place
* Applied to long waiting list
* Was pretty ambivalent about getting off the waiting list
* Took ground school
    * Pretty interesting
    * Class that people want to be in???

* Finally got off wait list
* No stress while flying
* Things seem to be clicking
    * Instructor absolutely gassing me up
    * Ground school knowlege?
    * Aviation youtube?

* Flip flop between wondering how you can possible learn all the things required
  to be a safe pilot and "oh this is interesting, I want to learn it all and I
  will."
